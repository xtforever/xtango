	Installation is complete.

	XTANGO uses a resource file, "xtango.res", to change where widgets
	appear and how they behave; however, XTANGO must be able to find this
	file.  Here are three suggested methods to tell XTANGO where to locate
	its widget resource file:

		1) cp /u1/pro/xtangoftp/tester/xtango/xtango.res /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Xtango


		   After the resource file is located in X11/app-defaults,
		   any users can use XTANGO from anywhere in the system.
		   You need to copy the resource file into X11/app-defaults
		   only once (or whenever you change widget sets).  The next
		   time you login, you can immediately use XTANGO without
		   any special setup.  Note that you probably have to be the
		   super-user (root) to write into this directory, so you may
		   want to ask your system administrator to set this up for you.

          2) cp /u1/pro/xtangoftp/tester/xtango/xtango.res /usr/dudes/stasko/app-defaults/Xtango
                   
                   Make your own app-defaults directory under your
                   home directory, then copy the xtango resources into
                   there as the file Xtango.  Then, in your .login, place
                   
                   setenv XAPPLRESDIR /usr/dudes/stasko/app-defaults

                   Basically, this builds your own application
                   defaults resource file.  (This is a good way to do it.)

		3) setenv XENVIRONMENT /u1/pro/xtangoftp/tester/xtango/xtango.res

		   To use this method, you must set XENVIRONMENT
		   *every* time you login, before using XTANGO.
		   An easy way to do this is to place this line in your
		   ".cshrc" (or whatever shell initialization file you're
		   using).  After that, you can immediately use XTANGO
		   every time you login without any further setup.

		4) cat /u1/pro/xtangoftp/tester/xtango/xtango.res >>/usr/dudes/stasko/.Xdefaults

		   Use this method if you are already using XENVIRONMENT.
		   ".Xdefaults" is the standard place to put resources for
		   all X11 applications you use; however, this file is
		   usually used to customize an application (ie. change
		   colors, etc).  If you choose this method, you only have
		   to place XTANGO's resources in ".Xdefaults" once.
	
		5) xrdb -merge /u1/pro/xtangoftp/tester/xtango/xtango.res

		   This is a last resort as you must manually tell XTANGO
		   where to find it's resources *every* time you start
		   X11.  An easy way to do this is to place this line in
		   your ".xinitrc" file.  After that, you can immediately
		   use XTANGO every time you login and start X11 without
		   any further setup.
	

	To try out the animations, select the appropriate method above to tell
	XTANGO where to find its widget resources.  Then change to the "anims"
	subdirectory and execute one of the binaries.

	(These four methods to tell XTANGO where to find its resources are
	 saved in a file named "RECOMMEND" for future reference).
