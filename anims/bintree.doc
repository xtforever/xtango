General info:

	A binary search tree is perhaps the most basic of the tree data 
structures.  Each node in such a tree can have up to two children, one called a
left child and the other called a right child.  The fundamental rule for 
organizing a binary search tree is:

     For every node X in the binary search tree, all the nodes in its left 
     subtree are less than or equal to X, and all the nodes in its right 
     subtree are greater than or equal to X.

	New data is always inserted as a leaf node, but any node, including the
root node, may be deleted.  This program animates the binary search used to
locate the node to be inserted or deleted, as well as whatever pointer
manipulations are involved.  This is especially helpful for some of the
deletion cases.


Compilation and Execution:

        To compile the program, you must first have XTANGO installed and the
above files placed in the 'anims' subdirectory.  Then, type:

        make -f bintreemake

which will create the executable file 'bintree'.  To run the program, simply
type 'bintree'.  No parameters are necessary, although input may be piped in.

        When you run the program, after the XTANGO window appears you will be
first asked whether or not you want to see the comparisons.  The comparisons
slow down the finding of the node to be deleted or the location to insert a
node, but if you haven't worked with binary trees in a while, it's a good
reminder of how a binary search is done.  Type 'y' to see them, 'n' not to.

        Next you'll get the instructions.  This program only deals with
positive integers.  Type 'i' followed by a number to insert that number into
the tree, 'd' followed by a number to delete that number from the tree, 'h' to
see the instructions again, and 'q' to stop.

        There are a limited number of levels in the tree; if you try to insert
below the bottom level, it will animate the search down to the bottom of the
screen, then stop, print an error message, and not insert the node.  The
program will not crash, however, and you can continue inserting and deleting.

        Also note that as of XTANGO version 1.42, the control buttons in the
XTANGO window WILL NOT WORK when the program is waiting for your input from the
keyboard.

        You can also create an input file which can be piped in.  Just remember
to make sure that the first character in the file is the 'y' or 'n', and the 
last character is a 'q'.
