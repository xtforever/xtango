This directory holds the new Animator front-end to xtango.  For more
information about the tool itself, read the animator.txt or
animator.ps (better) file.  

To compile the program, first look at (edit) the Makefile.  If you are
using the Motif widget set, there's nothing to change.  If you are
using either Athena or HP widgets, go in and uncomment the appropriate
#WIDGETS line and comment out the Xm one.  Then simply give the
"make" command in this directory.  

I have included a few sample animations (sample.in, prim1.in,
prim2.in, kruskal1.in, kruskal2.in, quicksort1.in) for you to try out.
To see what really can be done, try out the input file OSsimulator
(from Kay and Steve Robbins).  Make sure to resize your window to be
just about the whole screen.
