XTANGO is very similar to the original TANGO algorithm animation package.
The primary difference is that the system now sits directly on top of
the X11 Window System.  Another important difference is that XTANGO lacks
the interprocess communication and dynamic loading capabilities of the 
original TANGO.  If you are familiar with the original TANGO, using XTANGO
should be quite straightforward.

Here are some of the important differences to keep in mind:

* The algorithm code and animation code get bound together (along with
  the xtango library, xtango.o) in order to create an algorithm animation
  under XTANGO.

* XTANGO doesn't take command line options like TANGO did.  Its attributes
  can be set through menu choices on the animation window prior to running
  the animation.

* XTANGO only does animation by blting from an offscreen bitmap.  It cannot
  currently double buffer in the color table.

* XTANGO will work well on black and white monitors (it has built-in 
  environment checks.)  On B/W, patterns may represent either colors
  or TANGO_FILL_STYLEs.

* XTANGO allows any valid X color name to be used as the starting color
  for an image.  (Currently, color can only be changed to one of the 8
  basic types however.)

* You must choose the "run animation" button to start running an 
  animation in XTANGO.

* Algorithm operations are now specified by the TANGOalgoOp command
  and by defining their mapping in a special structure at the top of
  a program.
